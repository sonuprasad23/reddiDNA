## Overview

ReddiDNA leverages the power of Large Language Models (Google's Gemini Pro) to create a rich, detailed user persona based on a Reddit user's public comments and posts. This tool goes beyond simple data scraping to provide deep insights into a user's demographics, personality traits, motivations, behaviors, and frustrations, all backed by citable sources from their activity.

This project is a full-stack application featuring a React frontend and a Python (Flask) backend, containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **AI-Powered Persona Generation:** Uses Google's Gemini Pro to analyze text and infer detailed user characteristics.
-   **Deep Insight Categories:** Generates data on Demographics, Personality Sliders, Motivations, Behaviors, Frustrations, and Goals.
-   **Verifiable Citations:** Every piece of inferred data is linked back to the specific Reddit comment or post it was derived from.
-   **Interactive UI:** A clean, modern, and responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
-   **Engaging Loading State:** A dynamic countdown timer with fun messages and images keeps users engaged during analysis.
-   **Downloadable Reports:** Users can download a detailed text report of the persona with all sources included.
